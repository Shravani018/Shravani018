## ✨ About Me

I’m a **data scientist who cares about impact, ethics, and clarity**.

I enjoy building **end-to-end data systems** — from raw data and modeling to dashboards and automated decision pipelines — while keeping a strong focus on **Ethical AI**, transparency, and real-world usefulness.

When I’m not working with data, you’ll probably find me on a **tennis court 🎾** or reading about **AI governance, bias, and responsible ML**.
