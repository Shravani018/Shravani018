Master's student in Applied Data Science at **Frankfurt School of Finance & Management**.

With one year of experience as a Data Scientist in fintech, I have worked across automation, analytics, and machine learning. My work involved building automation pipelines and executive dashboards, as well as developing ML-driven solutions such as OCR-based KYC workflows, market sentiment analysis, and customer segmentation models.

## 🔍 Current Focus

Researching explainable AI and model interpretability frameworks, particularly SHAP and LIME, with an emphasis on fairness-aware approaches for building transparent ML systems in regulated financial environments.
